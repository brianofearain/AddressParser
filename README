This snippet includes a pared down version of code actually used in my production application. 
It should be useful as a template for Android REST consumers. 

Instructions:
1 Modify parameter passed to HttpClient in doInBackground()
 RESTful HTTP GET call
2 Instead of simply extracting text with
text = getASCIIContentFromEntity(entity);
Create parsing specific code according to use case
